Following the destruction of the [[Last Battle]], the center of the continent was war torn and uninhabitable for centuries. The all powerful mages that fought in the Last Battle left a barren wasteland where no life could live for centuries. 

Blaming powerful magic as a tool for destruction, many of the age feared it. This lad to a period of stagnation, where many mages were ostracized. It took many centuries for this outlook on mages to not be as bad. Due to this, many learned to live without magic for long periods of time. 

In the centuries it took for the land to recover, many saw that the center of the continent could be a great hub for the world, where everything and everyone would coalesce. In time, as life slowly returned over the next hundreds of years, a settlement would appear that would turn into a large sprawling metropolis. This city would come to be known as Confluence as it grew larger and larger, and was the largest city in the [[Continent]].

Nestled in the middle of grand valley, with mountain ranges on all sides, the city was in a good strategic position to defend itself. The after math of the war left many scars on the land, like craters, ravines. Powerful spells like meteor shower decimated the land before, and left it uninhabitable for a long time. Eventually, as the snowcapped mountains brought streams of water to fill the ravines, these streams would be be turned to rivers. The largest crater, almost a perfect perfect circle. Mages in secret would try to flow the streams and rivers into this this large crater. These attempts to return life to the area were done with much guilt, to try to make up for the sins of the past of stronger mages. Eventually this crater would turn into a large artificial lake that worked as the center of the city. 

It would take many centuries for this city to grow to the hub it is during the current age and time. 

## Magic in Confluence
Confluence was the first to have a less harsh view of magic. They were conflicted; it was what made the land a barren waste that it initially was, but also helped to bring life back to it. With more and more mages coming to live in Confluence, the guilt of the past magic users bore heavily on them. They did everything in their power to restore the land and show the world that magic was not to be used just for the purpose of destruction. This led to many of the current magic practitioners of the area to specialize in magic to help rebuild and not in magic that was used in combat. Sects would appear that were built up of battle mages, civic mages, and healing mages. Battle mages were seen as a somewhat necessity to the cruel world they inhabited with many monsters and dungeons. Civic mages were the ones who would use their magic for the betterment of the society they lived in, helping with roads, buildings, infrastructure, terraforming. Healing mages are self explanatory. 

Mages gave themselves stop gaps so they would not learn the most powerful magic of ages past. This lead to the magic from the past being slowly and slowly unlearned, to the point that most magic users no longer had access to them. 

Confluence was the first after the [[Last Battle]] to have a magic academy. Battle mages were heavily regulated, so not many would enter as battle mages. The most common mage at the academy are civic mages, who only learn magic that help the betterment of society. Healing mages were rare, and weren't present at the magic academy. The magic academy was mostly for wizards and sorcerers and bards. Warlocks, clerics, and druids were not present here, as they have their own institutions or sects to teach their forms of magic. 

Unlike other magic users, clerics and druids were the first magic users to be viewed more favorably, as their power was viewed as a coming from a benevolent force like gods, or a neutral force like nature. This lead to clerics and druids to be some of the first to be accepted into society by those less ignorant of the way magic works. 

Warlocks are still mostly ostracized, along with necromancers. They still exist, but society deems their magic foul and "bad", coming from misbegotten places. A warlock or necromancer living in Confluence will either have to hide their magical abilities or pass as something else.

## Current Time Confluence
Confluence is a major trade hub. Many trade routes to all major cities flow out of the center of the continent like water. Since Confluence is in the center of the continent, many of the worlds races would come to live in this settlement. The majority being the [[Humans|humans]], [[Elves|elves]], and [[Dwarves|dwarves]].

With the help of dwarves and civic mages, many tunnels were terraformed into the mountain ranges and served as safe routes through the mountains that surrounded the city. 
These routes were wide enough for four carriages to be able to fit at ounce, and handle easily the inbound and outbound of travelers to and from the city.
