## Overview
DND Campaign starts is set in a town named Bakersfield. It lies east of [[Confluence]], with a large forest to its northeast. The forest begins as a sparse groupings of trees. The tree line extends pretty far from either side of town. The forest holds monsters so many of the townsfolk don't venture very far into it. It's said that deeper into the forest lies [[Elves|elf]] territory. As you go deeper into the forest, the spares trees become more and more dense, until its a large, dense forest with a canopy that blocks out most of the sun. Mist seems to appear that disorients travelers from going further. People have taken to calling it the [[Mistwoods|mist woods]], due to the mist that appears as you go deeper in. 

The town serves under [[Goldvale]] city as its vassal. The city itself does not have 

The town's population consists mostly of [[Humans|humans]], with a mix of many other races as well. This is due to its proximity with neighboring cities and towns with higher populations and more diversity of species. With elven territory being relatively close by, elves make up a portion of the population as well. 

Besides the forest to the northeast, the town sits on fertile land. It derives its name from the high population of bakers, and the fields that provide them the wheat to bake. Wheat is a large portion of this towns economy, with a high population of farmers to till the fields.

## Mountains
This mountain range is fairly small compared to other mountains on the [[Continent]]. Mountains hold a [[Dwarves|dwarven]] population that carve towns and cities into mountainsides. [[Goliaths]] live near mountain peaks and is where they usually live, forming small villages and tribes. These two populations eventually bleed into Bakersfield as they trade with each other. The dwarves, along with some humans and goliaths, work the quarry and provide stone for the city that oversees the town. Sometimes townspeople will hire goliaths to help with manual labor like logging and carrying big bales of hay. These goliaths saw the work as lucrative, so they stayed. The town blacksmith is dwarven; seeing that this town needed one, one dwarven family came to ply their trade here. This family has stayed here for a few generations (long time for dwarves) to be the blacksmith.
