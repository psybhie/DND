In ages past, there were three powerful kingdoms. These warriors and mages help create powerful cities, structures, and molded the land like clay. These things are mostly things of the past now, with major countries and cities not really having access to these magics. The three major ancient countries with powerful mages and warriors would try to expand their borders, pouring into other countries. When one countries border was being pushed back, they would send resources to stop opposing armies.

Each of the countries was simultaneously trying to expand their borders and push back invaders from gaining ground. It would all come to a head in the center of the continent. With each countryâ€™s resources dwindling, they came to a treaty/agreement. They would meet at the center, with the [[Last Battle]] declaring who would have control over the continent. The end result being no one won; all countries vanished.

These countries left behind ruins, which explorers find every now and again.  Crumbling structures like mausoleums, cathedrals, seats of power. Toppled statues where only the legs remain. A head creeping up from the ground, a missing hand or weapon dropped after almost of millennium of neglect.
